# Git Ops

## Overview
Execute git operations safely while producing clear, conventional commit messages and workflow guidance.

## When to Use
- Running git commands (status, add, commit, push, pull)
- Generating smart commit messages
- Managing branches and merges

Avoid when:
- The task is unrelated to git operations

## Quick Reference

## Workflow
1. Confirm repository state and intent.
2. Load the git operations reference.
3. Execute the command safely.
4. Provide status summary and next steps.
